# Tierdom JeroenHeijmans.nl

This is the source code for [https://tierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl](https://tierdom.jeroenheijmans.nl), where you can find Tier Lists that I'd like to share.

## About this project

I love keeping lists.
And I'd love to keep my own lists, instead of using proprietary apps like GoodReads or IMDB.
So that's what this project is about.

For years I had the idea to create this into some kind of reusable... thing.
So others could use it too.
And that made the project overwhelming, thus stopping me from creating anything at all.

So for now this project is a hardcoded Tierdom (Fiefdom for Tier Lists) for just myself.
And if there's interest from others I'd happily revisit my original idea of sharing my setup with others.

## Documentation

Even though the project is _Open Source_, there is no current license or specific expectation for community collaboration.
As such there's also no documentation on developing, building, or running this code.
**There's also no specific license** currently; so although it _is_ open for viewing, it's not strictly open for anything else.
If you came here looking for something like that: please get in touch!
