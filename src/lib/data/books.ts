It has changed the way I write and talk with people. And not only in “public speaking” contexts. My e-mails, presentations, conversations, contributions in meetings, documentation, code, and even mundane interactions have been changed (for the better) by the knowledge from this book.\n\nOn a side note, being able to sell an idea is a crucial skill for software developers, as much as for any discipline. Sure, the book doesn't teach you how to code, but it teaches you equally important “soft” skills.` },

By knowing when tricks described in this book are being used on you, you will be able to adjust accordingly.\n\nIn addition, you can do the reverse. Proper and ethical use of the techniques from this book will help you in both personal and work life.\n\nA book I'm likely to read more than once, and if you know me, that is enormous praise!` },

It may be a little bit dated, and at times perhaps even a little bit “zealotry”, but if you know that up front you should go through this book in a breeze.\n\nPS. Since I wrote this review, there's been an “Anniversary Update” of sorts, and I presume it's even better than the original!` },

The book has aged, and I did struggle with grasping some parts of the context (what the **** is System 360?), but perhaps that allowed me to focus even more on the timeless bits of advice in this book.\n\nNot all the chapters (which are in fact seperate essays) were equally good.

That is: a brilliantly shaped open door, to greener pastures, and it was a lot of fun seeing someone go through the door in a deliberate manner.\n\nThe first part of the book is great: in clear chapters it is explained how to structure your domain in a codebase. I found the second part a little less entertaining, as it was not really bringing much (new) interesting info to the table.\n\nOn the whole though: a great book.` },

It taught me a lot about design heuristics, which is great for someone who isn't artistic in nature. Only two minor pieces of critique come to mind. First, the book is plain damn ugly, not even sticking to its own advice at times. Second, (mainly because the book's aged a bit) the advice doesn't carry over to online publishing without effort on the readers part. Nonetheless: recommended!` },

Yet, here we are!\n\nYes, you have to draw your own analogies to modern day life. Yes, those might be a stretch. But still, you can learn a lot from them. Many things from the book have a modern-day equivalent, and even if the analogy breaks at times, of even if the advice is not always timeless, it still nets a positive.` },

As long as you are prepared for that, it is actually a very helpful book. I've read every chapter as: “Okay, assuming the worst, what are my options?”. With that in mind, it is a very helpful book.\n\nAs such I don't intend to pick up many of the techniques. Things like “Chinese Water Torture” as a technique for negotiating budget for IT projects are not my style. But what the book does do is help recognize when others employ those techniques. And that's very helpful.` },

It is defined as “Code without unit tests”. A more appropriate title for this book would've been “Making Legacy Code Unit Testable”. Luckily, my colleague warned me beforehand, so I knew what I was getting into.\n\nSo I started reading with adjusted expextations, and the book lives up to them. It inspires to take a new look at the legacy code I'm currently dealing with, explains pretty well what refactoring- and dependency breaking techniques are available. Some chapters I skimmed (C macros for unit testing, anyone?), but on the whole: recommended!` },

I can do nothing but recommend it, because so many other books refer to this one.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to recommend this one though. Dated it may be, it is still a well-written book. In some sense it being dated is even fun: you already know which patterns withstood the test of time.` },

This requires that I should put effort into paying it forward to those who didn't or haven't got a similarly privileged situation.\n\nThis book helped me understand parts of this equation. Sure, it's not specifically about my trade, it focuses mostly on one particular aspect (race), and it's even somewhat tied into the situation in the United States as opposed to my region. But if you adjust for those minor changes, the book is still super helpful in all regards.` },

It revitalizes your enthusiasm for working in a truly agile manner. This can be summed up by an abbreviated and paraphrased anecdote from the book:\n\nThe Lean expert was shown around the factory, shown all the practices and ideas and whatnote, and was asked if he didn't think the western company was really “Lean” now!? The answer: I can't know, I wasn't here yesterday.\n\nAnd that pretty much sums up what's wrong with most companies trying to be “agile” nowadays, and it's great to read it so eloquently written down.` },

Technically a better deal, right?\n\nWrong! Reading through the book firmly settles the core message in your mind, because it is not 10 minutes.

It's a fun read, and you'll get through it in a few hours.\n\nIf you want to learn something new: don't pick up this book. That is assuming you've got your web-design basics alread: don't clutter the home page, make clickable things look clickable, less is more, do user testing, etc.\n\nYet still, a few years after reading it, I upgraded it to be on my recommendations list.

Things from psychology that will influence the way you do your work, your shopping, your hobbies, and in general how you make choices in your life, and view those of others. I recommend treating each chapter as a small book on its own to keep motivation up to read through the entire thing. But it's worth it!` },

Reality has caught up with it, and its proponents have already (true to the idea behind the book) evolved the way they run Design Sprints. But, if you know this, the book is still a great starting point, or at the least historical context.\n\nThe book details the original idea behind a “one week design sprint”, where you test and (in)validate an idea you have. With real users, and a real prototype.\n\nHaving tried this actual approach as well showed me the ideas in the book are sound, especially when adapted to your specific situation.` },

In anecodotal fashion, the anatomy of a great presentation is laid out. To be used as inspiration for your own presentations, as well as other situations where you want to convince someone of your ideas.\n\nAnd that latter part is where it shines, and why it makes my list of recommended books.
