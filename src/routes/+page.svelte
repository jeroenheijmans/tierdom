    I have a love-hate relationship with list- and review authoring web applications.
    The likes GoodReads, IMDB, TripAdvisor, BoardGameGeek, and others...
    They are great, but <strong>they scatter <em>my</em> data all over the web.</strong>

  <p class="mt-4">
    What you see in front of you are my (tier) lists.
    Things I liked... or not so much.
    Sometimes even with a little review or explanation.

    Enjoy!
